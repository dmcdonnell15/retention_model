# Retention Tiering

The goal of this project is to predict which students are at risk of not being retained to the subsequent term, and to target the highest risk students with additional academic supports. Each folder contains at least some of the following:
    * Folders for each term that the retention model was in place
    * 
    * Model-building notebooks for each individual term, and scripts that run the model on existing students to put them into high risk, medium risk, and low risk tiers so college campuses can target their outreach appropriately. 

#### To run the model:
1. Download the jupyter notebook for the appropriate term to create and edit the model
2. Download the python script to use the created model to run on current-term students and upload to SQL server for use in OpenBook
